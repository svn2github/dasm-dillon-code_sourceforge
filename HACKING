Hacking DASM

Preface

This is preliminary as in nobody is taking it seriously anyway.
Still, if you have feedback on it, send it! Let's hope that at
some point in the future, it's actually a standard we adhere to.

Rules
-----

Thank you for considering DASM as a project to hack on. Here are a
few short rules to ensure things go smoothly.

- Read the Linux coding style and try to stick to it; we try, at
  least in new code, and we're slowly converting the older code
  as well.

- If you add a new text file to the repository, make sure you set
  the svn:eol-style=native property so we can get rid of linefeed
  issues once and for all; we've adapted

    svn-eol-style.txt
    (see http://www.apache.org/dev/svn-eol-style.txt for original)

  from the Apache project for DASM, you can just merge that into
  your local SVN configuration and you're good to go; for most
  file extensions anyway, feel free to add more and submit a new
  version of svn-eol-style.txt to us; do *not* ever *remove*
  svn:eol-style=native from any files!

- Do *not* commit code that doesn't compile without warnings; it
  took quite an effort to make sure everything is C11 compliant
  and works well on POSIX systems; if you find a warning in the
  existing code base (with a newer version of gcc for example),
  let us know ASAP and (ideally) submit a fix right away.

- Do *not* commit code that doesn't pass all the test cases; if
  your changes are intentionally yielding different results, we
  need to discuss them on the developer mailing list before you
  commit the code.

There will probably be a few more rules in the future, and the
current rules are subject to change as well as the world keeps
turning. Check back here if in doubt about anything.
