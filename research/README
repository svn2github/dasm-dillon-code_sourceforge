$Id$

This is a directory to keep experiments in, stuff that was
written to explore some aspect of DASM and improve on it.

Do *not* put an actual *branch* of DASM here, that's what
the branches/ directory in the SVN root is for! (However,
snippets of potential replacement code are okay I guess?)

We don't put this stuff into distributions, but people who
use SVN to track DASM will see it.
