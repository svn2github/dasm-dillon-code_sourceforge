===========================
Things to fix at some point
===========================

Note: All of these are "nice to have" things, not essential
for functionality and (hopefully) not the cause of bugs. We
are hiding the file all the way down here for a reason...

- use GNU indent to make code more consistent
  - current .indent.pro not right, need to adjust
  - when to do this? before 2.20.11?

- hash1() exists twice, in main.c and symbol.c
  - very similar, should be unified?
  - hash function doesn't seem very good?
  - NOTE: if both are used on the same global data
    structures, there may be a bug here after all!
