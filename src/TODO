===========================
Things to fix at some point
===========================

Note: All of these are "nice to have" things, not essential
for functionality and (hopefully) not the cause of bugs. We
are hiding the file all the way down here for a reason...

- for some reason DASM doesn't exit with proper code
  - echo $? after an error still says 0, not useful...

- negative.asm test case still not quite right
  - need to make range checking for literals fool proof

- use GNU indent to make code more consistent
  - current .indent.pro not right, need to adjust
  - when to do this? before 2.20.11?
  - maybe astyle is a better, more conservative choice?

- hash1() exists twice, in main.c and symbol.c
  - very similar, should be unified?
  - hash function doesn't seem very good?
  - NOTE: if both are used on the same global data
    structures, there may be a bug here after all!

- several things in main.c are dubious
  - strlower() exported, not used outside
  - the *alloc functions, used all over
  - all that should go into a separate util.c
    to properly modularize
  - asmerr should be refactored, type for error
    code can be enum type, does it really have
    to return the error code? strange recursion
    may be the root of that...

- MNEMONIC tables could be simplified
  - currently they are written directly, could
    use a macro (or several) to fill in mostly
    identical information
  - a deeper issues is that the same struct is
    use statically as is dynamically later; so
    I think we could get rid of the whole NULL
    for the *next if we had a version for the
    static stuff and a version (close to the
    current one) for the dynamic stuff; do we
    even need the static stuff in the first
    place? a function to add an opcode and
    the relevant information might work just
    as well...

- extension support and error codes
  - the F8 extension set the example of extending the
    global error codes
  - luckily F8 doesn't check for a range of error code
    values, otherwise we'd been stuck with having to
    be careful about order in there
  - it might be good to convert the example error codes
    to have an explicit "ERROR_F8_CODES_START" value and
    of course an "_END" as well, then extensions can
    check ranges as long as we don't *mix* extensions in
    the enum; but that would be bad style anyway...

- both memusage and valgrind say that we are leaking
  - however, this probably only matters for Amiga OS 3 users
    - even there the C library hopefully takes care of it?
  - any OS out there where memory is not freed on exit?

- Matt Dillon's fixes and extensions
  - dasm-2.15 permalloc patch for SPARC? seems simple
  - new version of ftohex? should import easily...
    - actually, there's more to this as we should add options
      - to select CTRL-Z at the end (old EEPROM programmers)
      - CR/LF separators (Intel's standard is flexible)
      - see Matt's email 2008/04/06
  - new ftobin? obviously easy, we don't have one :-)
  - harder: compare code bases for other fixes! :-/

- new copyright/license header
  - should Thomas be in there because of F8 support?
  - who else holds a copyright on some piece of DASM?
