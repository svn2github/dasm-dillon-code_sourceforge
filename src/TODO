===========================
Things to fix at some point
===========================

Note: All of these are "nice to have" things, not essential
for functionality and (hopefully) not the cause of bugs. We
are hiding the file all the way down here for a reason...

- use GNU indent to make code more consistent
  - current .indent.pro not right, need to adjust
  - when to do this? before 2.20.11?
  - maybe astyle is a better, more conservative choice?

- hash1() exists twice, in main.c and symbol.c
  - very similar, should be unified?
  - hash function doesn't seem very good?
  - NOTE: if both are used on the same global data
    structures, there may be a bug here after all!

- both memusage and valgrind say that we are leaking
  - however, this probably only matters for Amiga OS 3 users
    - even there the C library hopefully takes care of it?
  - any OS out there where memory is not freed on exit?

- Matt Dillon's fixes and extensions
  - dasm-2.14+ contain a (partial?) patch for 65c02 support?
  - dasm-2.15 permalloc patch for SPARC? seems simple
  - new version of ftohex? should import easily...
  - new ftobin? obviously easy, we don't have one :-)
  - harder: compare code bases for other fixes! :-/

- new copyright/license header
  - already in Makefile, move it to all other sources
  - should Thomas be in there because of F8 support?
  - who else holds a copyright on some piece of dasm?
