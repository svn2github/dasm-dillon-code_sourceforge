Some DASM test cases for Atari 2600 games

I am not too sure about the status if these, i.e. if it is okay to
distribute them as part of DASM. It should be since their license
doesn't state any restriction and they are available all over the
net, but I am not sure. If you have concerns about this, please
let me know.
