I am trying to put together a cram-based [1] test suite. I hope to cover
mostly user-interface stuff, things like DASM's exit status, diagnostic
messages, etc.

So far the biggest hassle with cram is that it runs tests in its own weird
temporary directories; copying stuff into those is a bit iffy; but we're
working on it.
