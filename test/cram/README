I am trying to put together a cram-based [1] test suite. I hope to cover
mostly user-interface stuff, things like DASM's exit status, diagnostic
messages, etc.

So far the biggest hassle with cram is that it runs tests in its own weird
temporary directories; copying stuff into those is a bit iffy; but we're
working on it.

[1] See https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cram for details. Here's a quick
summary:

- Lines beginning with two spaces, a dollar sign, and a space are run in the
  shell.
- Lines beginning with two spaces, a greater than sign, and a space allow
  multi-line commands.
- All other lines beginning with two spaces are considered command output.
- Output lines ending with a space and the keyword (re) are matched as
  Perl-compatible regular expressions.
- Lines ending with a space and the keyword (glob) are matched with a
  glob-like syntax. The only special characters supported are * and ?.
  Both characters can be escaped using \, and the backslash can be
  escaped itself.
- Output lines ending with either of the above keywords are always first
  matched literally with actual command output.
- Lines ending with a space and the keyword (no-eol) will match actual
  output that doesnâ€™t end in a newline.
- Actual output lines containing unprintable characters are escaped and
  suffixed with a space and the keyword (esc). Lines matching unprintable
  output must also contain the keyword.
- Anything else is a comment.
